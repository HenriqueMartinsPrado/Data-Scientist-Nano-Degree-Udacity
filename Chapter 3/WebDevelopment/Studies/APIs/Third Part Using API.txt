How the Filter Works

    This version of the web app has a filter made with a form. When you check the boxes on the form and click submit, the form gets submitted to the index.html page. It's essentially a circle where the index.html loads, the form gets submitted to index.html itself, and then index.html loads again. With a web form, you could also submit the form to a different web page.

    On the back-end, routes.py can access the information that was submitted with the web form; the front-end receives information about which boxes were checked.

Code your Project

    Start working on your project! Go back to the "Workspace Portfolio Exercise" with the template code. You'll find it earlier in this Portfolio Exercise lesson. Here are a few APIs that you might find interesting to work with:

        World Bank API
        API for Entertainment Industry Data
        City of Berlin Open Data API
        
    Many government and city agencies have APIs where you can access city data.
