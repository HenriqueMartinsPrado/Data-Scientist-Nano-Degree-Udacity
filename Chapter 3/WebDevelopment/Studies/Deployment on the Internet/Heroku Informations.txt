Web site to install the heroku
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

heroku login

Before to public any app in heroku:

    1. Create a folder to store all information of the app inside it.
    2. In this folder we need to create a file called Procfile. This file says to Herolku what to do when initiating the app.
        Inside thie file should have:
            web gunicorn worldbank:app 
        This command will call gunicor library and will execute my app
    3. In the app.py, remove the app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=3001, debug=True)
    4. In this folder, I need to open virtual env and install all packages I will need in my app.

    5. I can execute the command: pip freeze
        You're going to see all python packages already installed

        I need to put all information collected by pip freeze inside a file called requirements.txt
        We can simple do this with this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt
        Heroku will search for this file inside the folder.

    6. This folder should be a git repository, so I need to initiate it: git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "my commit message here"

            If required:
                git config user.email "nome@host.com"
                git config user.name "Henrique"

    7. The last step here is to create a web app in Heroku, for that, type the command below:
            heroku create <name of your app>

        The name of the app must be unique to create in heroku. Recommend to user my initials ("hmp")

        After create and execute those steps above, if you type git remote -v you need to see something like this:
            heroku  https://git... (fetch)
            heroku  https://git... (push)

        So, to public the information, type: git push heroku master
        In this part, we published the files in git heroku repository. You will recieve the http that your app was puslished on the internet.
