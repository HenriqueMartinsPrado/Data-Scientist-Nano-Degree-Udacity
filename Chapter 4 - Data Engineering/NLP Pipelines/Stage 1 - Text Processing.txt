Stage 1: Text Processing

    The first chunk of this lesson will explore the steps involved in text processing, the first stage of the NLP pipeline.

        Why Do We Need to Process Text?

                Extracting plain text: Textual data can come from a wide variety of sources: the web, PDFs, word documents, speech recognition systems, book scans, etc. Your goal is to extract plain text that is free of any source specific markup or constructs that are not relevant to your task.
                
                Reducing complexity: Some features of our language like capitalization, punctuation, and common words such as a, of, and the, often help provide structure, but don't add much meaning. Sometimes it's best to remove them if that helps reduce the complexity of the procedures you want to apply later.
                What Text Processing Will You Do in This Lesson?

        You'll prepare text data from different sources with the following text processing steps:

        1.Cleaning to remove irrelevant items, such as HTML tags
        2.Normalizing by converting to all lowercase and removing punctuation
        3.Splitting text into words or tokens
        4.Removing words that are too common, also known as stop words
        5.Identifying different parts of speech and named entities
        6.Converting words into their dictionary forms, using stemming and lemmatization

    After performing these steps, your text will capture the essence of what was being conveyed in a form that is easier to work with.
