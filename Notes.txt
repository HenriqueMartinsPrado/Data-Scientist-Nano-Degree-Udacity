			Considerations:
				1. In your repository you should have two files:
					1.1. Folder that its name is the name of your package
					1.2. File called setup.py 
					
							from setuptools import setup

							setup(name='<name_of_your_package>',
								  version='0.2',
								  description='Gaussian distributions',
								  packages=['<name_of_your_package>'],
								  author='Henrique M. Prado',
								  author_email='hmartins.prado@gmail.com',
								  zip_safe=False)

				2. Inside your folder metioned in 1.1 item above you should have:
					2.1. Classe(s) .py (class_name.py)
					2.2. README.md file
					2.3. __init__.py
					2.4. license.py

			The commands to upload the package in TEST PYPI (PYTHON PACKAGE INDEX) are:

				1. Inside the folder that you have the package folder and setup.py file, type:
					python3 setup.py sdist
				2. pip3 install twine
				3. twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* 
					(For more information: https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/)
				4. You can access yout repository in yout account inside the https://test.pypi.org/manage/projects/
				5. Now, you can download yout package from the intenet typing:

			As I already installed the package at the test pypi, now I will uninstall the package in my computer
				pip3 uninstall hmp_distributions

			Now, as I already installed in pypi repository (central repository to download and install packages in python), I can only install using pip:
				pip3 install hmp_distributions
