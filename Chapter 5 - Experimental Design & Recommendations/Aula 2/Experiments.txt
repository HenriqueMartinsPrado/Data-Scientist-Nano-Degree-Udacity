Experiments

    In the social and medical sciences, an experiment is defined by comparing outcomes between two or more groups, and ensuring equivalence between the compared groups except for the manipulation that we want to test. Our interest in an experiment is to see if a change in one feature has an effect in the value of a second feature, like seeing if changing the layout of a button on a website causes more visitors to click on it. Having multiple groups is necessary in order to compare the outcome for when we apply the manipulation to when we do not (e.g. old vs. new website layout), or to compare different levels of manipulation (e.g. drug dosages). We also need equivalence between groups so that we can be as sure as possible that the differences in the outcomes were only due to the difference in our manipulated feature.

    Equivalence between groups is typically carried out through some kind of randomization procedure. A unit of analysis is the entity under study, like a page view or a user in a web experiment. If we randomly assign our units of analysis to each group, then on the whole, we should expect the feature distributions between groups to be about the same. This theoretically isolates the changes in the outcome to the changes in our manipulated feature. Of course, we can always dig deeper afterwards to see if certain other features worked in tandem with, or against, our manipulation.
