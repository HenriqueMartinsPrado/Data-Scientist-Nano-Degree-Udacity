Observational Studies

    In an experiment, we exert a lot of control on a system in order to narrow down the changes in our system from one source to one output. Observational studies, on the other hand, are defined by a lack of control. Observational studies are also known as naturalistic or correlational studies. In an observational study, no control is exerted on the variables of interest, perhaps due to ethical concerns or a lack of power to enact the manipulation. This often comes up in medical studies. For example, if we want to look at the effects of smoking on health, the potential risks make it unethical to force people into smoking behaviors. Instead, we need to rely on existing data or groups to make our determinations.

    We typically cannot infer causality in an observational study due to our lack of control over the variables. Any relationship observed between variables may be due to unobserved features, or the direction of causality might be uncertain. (We'll discuss this more later in the lesson.) But simply because an observational study does not imply causation does not mean that it is not useful. An interesting relationship might be the spark needed to perform additional studies or to collect more data. These studies can help strengthen the understanding of the relationship we're interested in by ruling out more and more alternative hypotheses.
