Side Note: Factorial Designs

    Factorial designs manipulate the value of multiple features of interest. For example, with two independent manipulations "X" and "Y", we have four conditions: "control", "X only", "Y only", "X and Y". Experimental designs where multiple features are manipulated simultaneously are more frequently seen in engineering and physical sciences domains, where the system units tend to be under stricter control. They're less seen in the social and medical realms, where individual differences can impede experiment creation and analysis.
