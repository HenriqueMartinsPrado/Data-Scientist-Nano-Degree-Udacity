Side Note: Non-Probabilistic Sampling

    As noted at the start, the goal of sampling is to use a subset of the whole population to make inferences about the full population, so that we didn't need to record data from everyone. To that end, probabilistic sampling techniques were described above to try and obtain a sample that was representative of the whole. However, it's useful to note that there also exist non-probabilistic sampling techniques that simplify the sampling process, at the risk of harming the validity of your results. (We'll discuss the term 'validity' later in the lesson.)

    For example, a convenience sample records information from readily available units. Studies performed in the social sciences at colleges often fall into this kind of sampling. The people participating in these tasks are often just college students, rather than representatives of the population at large. When performing inferences from this type of study, it's important to consider how well your results might apply to the population at large.

    One notable example of a convenience sample resulting in a grave error comes from the prediction made by magazine "The Literary Digest" on the 1936 U.S. presidential election. While they predicted a healthy victory by candidate Alf Landon, the final result ended with a landslide victory by opposing candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt. This major error is attributed to their methods capturing a non-representative sample of the population, which included looking at the results of a mail-in survey from their magazine readers. Since the mail-ins were voluntary, and the magazine subscribers were already not well-representative of the general population, focusing on the people who returned surveys gave a large bias toward Landon.
