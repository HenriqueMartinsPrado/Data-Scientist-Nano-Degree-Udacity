Knowledge Based Recommendations

    A knowledge based recommendation is one in which knowledge about the item or user preferences are used to make a recommendation.

    Knowledge based recommendations are pretty common when purchasing luxury items. Take a look at the filters available on Zillow in the image below. This is an example of building in a knowledge based recommendation, as users can add their own preferences to the items that are provided.

    Often a rank based algorithm is provided along with knowledge based recommendations to bring the most popular items in particular categories to the user's attention.
