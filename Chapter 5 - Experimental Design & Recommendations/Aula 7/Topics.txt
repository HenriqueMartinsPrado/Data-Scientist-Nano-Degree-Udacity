Topics

    In this lesson, you will learn about three main topics:

    We will look from a high level at how you might go about validating your recommendations.
    We will look at matrix factorization as a method to use machine learning to make recommendations.
    We will look at combining recommendation techniques to make predictions to existing and new users and for existing and new items.
    As we go through this lesson, you will come to realize that there are a lot of difficulties in working with recommendation engines which make them still an exciting field to study! This is especially true when you combine your recommendations with a specific product type.

    Recommending movies, recommending restaurants, or recommending clothing might happen in a number of different ways. However, the techniques you will learn in this lesson are often extendable to any of these cases.
