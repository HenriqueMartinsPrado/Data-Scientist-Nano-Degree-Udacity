Correction
You might notice in the screencast code that the SparkSession object wasn't instantiated explicitly. This is because Judit was using the same environment from a previous exercise. In general, you would have to instantiate an object using code like this:


spark = SparkSession \
    .builder \
    .appName("Wrangling Data") \
    .getOrCreate()
